# Green Riders Cycling Team Manager
A team manager application for my cycling team, build with ASP.NET Core 3.0

#### Remaining features
* Show races differently if I already required an entry
* Upload and view images for races
* Profile image for user
* Redesign of some page (points, bills fe.)

#### Future plans
* Race distances should be refactored: a rider can be capable to choose a distance, not just a race
* Enable to add an event without distance (just in case of type = other)
* Add Google Calendar event if I required an entry
* Design update by Tomi
* Public part of the site: about us, riders, contact
* Mobile design
* Entry form and GDPR form statistics (only admins)
